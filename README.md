# Screen Recorder
A screen recorder that I created to record my screen, because why pay for some random applications when you create one, right?

### TO-DO

- IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (URGENT!)
    ```
    Right now program cannot handle high frame rates gets 30ish frames with my i7 8750H CPU
    How can I solve this?
    ---Maybe I can run screen capturing functions on GPU
    ---Maybe I can create false frames after capturing to mimic the frame rates
    ```
- Give user resolution options
- Record computer audio synched with FPS and merge this with video file
- Create a GUI element to help user name the recorded video and specify save location
- Add a timer to show user recorded video length while recording

### TO-Done
- Create a GUI to help user start and stop recording (DONE)
- Give user FPS options (DONE)
