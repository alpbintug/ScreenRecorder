# Screen Recorder
A screen recorder that I created to record my screen, because why pay for some random applications when you create one, right?

### TO-DO

- IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (URGENT!)
    ```
    Right now program cannot handle high frame rates gets 30ish frames with my i7 8750H CPU
    How can I solve this?
    
    PROBLEMS:

    ---If I store screenshots to speed up recording process, I run out of memory quickly
    ---Taking screenshots is too slow
    ---Processing and saving screenshots is just a bit slow

    IDEAS:

    ---Reduce resolution, then upscale it in post processing?
    ---Reduce frame rate, then upscale it in post processing?
    ---Use Windows API? WHO CARES ABOUT PORTABILITY
    ---Maybe if I re-run the code enough times framerates will increase
    ---JUST GO WRITE THIS IN ASSEMBLY ALREADY
    ---Wait this makes sense
    ---Oh boy...
    ```
- Give user resolution options
- Record computer audio synched with FPS and merge this with video file
- Create a GUI element to help user name the recorded video and specify save location
- Add a timer to show user recorded video length while recording

### TO-Done
- Create a GUI to help user start and stop recording (DONE)
- Give user FPS options (DONE)
